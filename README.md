The following instructions are to be done for the program to work:

  (EG. C:\FruitExam) placing it other than the C: drive would disable the images in the 
  ExamGUI to appear.

- Run the Python file 'LoginGUI.py'

- Enter in a username and password: (below is a username in the database with its password)
	EXISTING USERNAME: bits
	EXISTING PASSWORD: kang123
